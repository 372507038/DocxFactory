(DocxFactory)[https://github.com/docxfactory/docxfactory]
==================

DocxFactory only includes third party components that have a permissive free license.

According to Wikipedia, "A permissive free software license is a class of free software license with minimal
requirements about how the software can be redistributed. Such licenses therefore make no guarantee that future
generations of the software will remain free. This is in contrast to licenses which have reciprocity / share-alike
requirements. Both sets of free software licenses offer the same freedoms in terms of how the software can be used,
studied, and privately modified. A major difference is that when the software is being redistributed (either modified or
unmodified), permissive licenses permit the redistributor to restrict access to the modified source code, while copyleft
licenses do not allow this restriction.". The third party components included in DocxFactory are standard components
widely used in commercial products.

The following documentation notices are required by third party components included in DocxFactory:
